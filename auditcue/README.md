# AuditCue SaaS Automation Builder

Welcome to the AuditCue project! This repository contains the code for a SaaS Automation builder application designed to streamline user signup and authentication processes.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular architecture, making it easy to manage and extend. Below is an overview of the key components:

1. **Signup and Authentication**
   - **Purpose**: Handle user registration and login processes.
   - **Components**:
     - `internal/auth/handler.go`: Defines HTTP endpoints for signup and authentication.
     - `internal/auth/service.go`: Implements business logic for user validation, password hashing, and token generation.

2. **API Documentation**
   - **Purpose**: Provide clear documentation for API endpoints.
   - **Components**:
     - `docs/api.md`: Documents each endpoint, including method types (GET, POST), request parameters, response formats, and example requests.

3. **Database Management**
   - **Purpose**: Manage database schema and migrations.
   - **Components**:
     - `internal/database/migrations/001_initial.sql`: Defines the initial database schema.
     - Implement migration logic to apply changes to the database schema over time.

4. **OAuth Connections**
   - **Purpose**: Integrate third-party authentication providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).
   - **Components**:
     - `internal/connections/oauth/oauth.go`: Handles OAuth flow, including redirecting users and managing tokens.

5. **Models**
   - **Purpose**: Define data structures used in the application.
   - **Components**:
     - `internal/models/user.go`: Defines the User model and any related methods.

6. **Types**
   - **Purpose**: Define common types used across the application.
   - **Components**:
     - `internal/types/types.go`: Defines request and response types for better type safety.

## Getting Started

1. **Set Up the Project Structure**: Use the provided `scripts/setup.sh` script to create the necessary directories and files.

2. **Implement the Signup and Auth Modules**: Start by defining the user model and implementing the signup and authentication logic.

3. **Create API Documentation**: As you build the API, document each endpoint in `docs/api.md`.

4. **Set Up Database Migrations**: Define the initial schema in `internal/database/migrations/001_initial.sql` and implement migration logic.

5. **Integrate OAuth**: If needed, implement OAuth connections for third-party authentication.

6. **Test the Application**: Write tests for each module to ensure functionality and reliability.

7. **Document the Project**: Update this `README.md` with setup instructions and usage guidelines.

By following this modular approach, you can systematically build the SaaS Automation builder app for AuditCue while ensuring clarity and maintainability in your codebase.
